                        <p>
                             HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  HTML typically used for creating the structure of a Web page, and is the most basic building block of the Web.  Web browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Edge use HTML tags to determine how to display certain things on pages like text, images, and links.  In an HTML document, there is a head, and a body.  In the body is where you would write your code to structure your page.  
                            </p>
                             <p>After establishing a structure of a webpage with HTML, web developers will more commonly use other coding or markup languages like JavaScript and CSS to style, or add to the functionality of the webpage.  To do this, you would have to link other files into your HTML document.
                        </p>

<h3>
Inline Elements vs. Block Elements
</h3>
<p>
   Block elements start from a new line by default and cover area from left to right for as much as it needs to take up.  It covers the whole horizontal space of its parent elements.  Inline elements never start from a new line and only cover the width according to the size of tags in the element.
