                     CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets! It is a language coders use to display websites in a more formatted fashion. HTML documents are used to organize codes into different sections like divides, headers, etc. CSS documents are linked to the HTML files to make them more "pretty" or pleasing to look at. Attributes like color, sizing, and page layout can come from CSS programming. Without CSS, this page would be poorly aligned and filled with drab colors.

                CSS can be used either inline or externally. Inline means that within the HTML document, a CSS line could be written to modify a section of HTML. However, using CSS externally is a much better option. This is done by linking a separate document ending in .css and using id, class, and section tags to edit several sections at a time. With inline, a coder could only edit the specific section that they chose, but in an external document, a coder could modify a number of similar sections at the same time using corresponding tags!

            <p>
                CSS uses a specific syntax! In order for the code to work, a coder must follow this layout:
               <div class = "syntax"> selector {property to change: value;} </div>
            </p>
            <p>
